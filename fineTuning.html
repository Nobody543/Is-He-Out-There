    <h1>The Fine Tuning Argument</h1>

    <div class='reveal'>
      <p>After the Design Argument was so efficiently countered by Darwin's Theory of Evolution, a new, more modern, and more convincing argument was born. Probably one of the most modern and convincing argumetns for the existence of God is the Fine Tuning Argument, developed and fine tuned throughout the 20th Century. Here it is:</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class='reveal'>
      <p>Before reading this argument, I would highly advise understanding the <a href='design.html'>Design Argument</a> first. The Design Argument can be countered very effectively via a clear understanding of the process of evolution. This argument is very similar, except it cannot. The fine tuning argument states that there are many requirements for life. These are such that the odds of all these being fulfilled are so low that a Grand Architect must have designed the universe such that they are, and that we can exist. The first is a more basic form: we need things like liquid water for evolution to occur. There are very few planets that contain enough, or even any for this to occur. As a result, the odds that we evolved on a planet that does have liquid water were very little. This can easily be countered by the idea that in an constantly expanding, almost infinite universe, there would be a large number of planets that do contain water. Evolution could only occur on one of these planets. The odds that evolution occurs at some point on one of these planets, all of which contain water, given billions of years, are much higher, especially considering the fact that evolution, as soon as it is started, can continue much more easily (it is the beginning that is difficult to make occur, but even this will happen considering the aforementioned mentioned circumstances). However, there is also a second form of the argument. For our universe to exist in a manner that would allow life to exist and evolution to occur, Martin Rees, in his book Just Six Numbers, describes how there are 6 numbers in the universe, which could not be any different. For example, one is called E: 0.7%, the percentage of the mass of two hydrogen nuclei released as energy during nuclear fusion as they form a helium atom. If it were less, say 0.06%, the universe would be made entirely out of single hydrogen atoms, and there is no way we could evolve to live in this universe, not least because ourselves are made mostly of carbon atoms. If it were any higher, say 0.08%, no hydrogen would exist at all, and it would all form at minimum helium. This would mean ordinary stars like the Sun could never exist, and neither could water, both of which are proven to be essential for our survival. As well as this, any other change in E would drastically affect the periodic table, and chemistry as we know it, so that many elements that we depend on such as oxygen and carbon might not exist at all either. This is just one of many constants that our survival in the universe depends on. As we know it, there is only one universe, so there was only one chance for these numbers to be exactly correct, and if they werenâ€™t, we could not possibly have existed. How, then, could we exist? How could this amazingly unlikely event have occurred? The only explanation is that the universe was designed to be so. Who is the grand designer? An omniscient (since they would have to know how to design things to this level of detail which is extraordinarily complect) and omnipotent (to be able to enact this design) being. Who is omniscient and omnipotent? God. God then is the only possible Grand Designer, and since this Grand Designer must exist, so must God.</p>
